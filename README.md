# ALIENS-R-REAL: JavaScript-and-DOM-Manipulation

Creates a basic HTML web page using the UFO dataset (array of JavaScript objects), that appends a table to the page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. Table columns include, date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment. The user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings based on the table columns.
